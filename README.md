# The Mountain in Question
Don't you wish you could just carry a mountain shrine with you through every stage? Well now you can!

MONS CRISIUM
The teleporter event grants extra items BUT the boss is harder.

The number of bonus items and difficulty increase are configurable.
Additionally, the effect can be set to multiply with mountain shrines rather than add on top of them (e.g. 2 items and 2 activated shrines grants 9 times the items and difficulty instead of 5.)
